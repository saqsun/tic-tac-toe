# Setup

To use this bootstrap you’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

`git clone https://github.com/koreezgames/phaser3-es6-webpack.git`

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

`npm install`

## 3. Start the development server:

Run:

`npm run start`

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:8080 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

## Build for production:

Run:

`npm run build`

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
